[Design Document](GameDocumentation.pdf)


## Game Identity

## Design Pillars
Platformer, Action

## General/Story/Mechanics Summary
The game uses a platform shooter to take the player to the next level in each scene.
However there is a twist, the game focuses on morality so if the player hurts an enemy
instead of dodging a part of the entire map will disappear making it harder for the player to
win. The game has a way of winning the level without killing your enemy, you have to find
that path in each level. You can win the game with killing your enemy as well however it is a
lot harder.

## Features
Platform Scroller, Camera, Shooting, Animation, Dissapearing Elements.

## Interface
The player interface will be using the keyboard on computer, will future adoption to
mobile development using a onscreen joystick. The player uses arrow keys to move and jump
and then the player uses the spacebar key to shoot kunai blades.
Created using GoDot Gaming Engine
